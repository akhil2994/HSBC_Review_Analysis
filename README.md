# HSBC_Review_Analysis
Analysis on HSBC UK's reviews and predicting the rating with a time series model called LSTM

Findings:

From the line plot we can see that the number of counts for words pertaining to customers, services, branch, money, card, business, security etc are at a stake. More number of reviews are related to hsbc, account and bank highlighting the fact that number of issues are more with the bank and account compared to other issues. 

Possible reasons could be:
1. Bank opening hours
2. Bank services
3. Account related issues
4. Transactions, etc
